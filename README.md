## NewsWire-Client
NewsWire is a web application that allows users to create, read, update, and delete news articles. The application is built using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, and uses React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend.

## Features

NewsWire provides the following features:
-Create news articles: Users can create new news articles by filling out a form that includes fields for the article's title, content, author, and category.
-Read news articles: Users can view a list of all the news articles that have been created, as well as view the details of individual articles.
-Update news articles: Users can edit the title, content, author, and category of existing news articles.
-Delete news articles: Users can delete news articles they no longer want to keep in the system.

## Lessons Learned


-MVC architecture can help to organize the codebase: By separating the application logic into models, views, and controllers, it becomes easier to maintain and extend the codebase. It also promotes the separation of concerns and makes the code easier to test.

-React can be a powerful tool for building user interfaces: React's component-based approach allows for reusable and modular code, which can save time and effort in the long run. React's virtual DOM also helps to optimize the rendering performance of the application.
